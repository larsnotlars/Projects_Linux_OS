Implementation of some Linux commands as well as projects using the Linux Cernel

The commands env and xargs which are widely known to Linux users were implemented in C using the fork() system call.
Both programs are clones which have reduced options to their actual implementations.

The perfect program searches for perfect numbers in a given interval and uses POSIX multithreading to do so.

The prisoner program simulates the famous prisoner problem both with random choice and the optimal strategy.
This makes use of multithreading as well as mutual exclusion.

The Quizgame project is a game that fetches math questions and answers with a system call in a childprocess and asks the user to input the correct answer.
